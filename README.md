# vimrc

I'm a VIM guy. Here's [my .vimrc file](https://github.com/ajpierce/vimrc/blob/master/.vimrc).
It's commented!

## Plugin Management

I use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) to manage my plugins.

Install Vundle like so:

    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Once Vundle is in place, and assuming you've specified your plugins in your
`.vimrc` file correctly, simply:

    vim +PluginInstall +qall

Congratulations! Your (my) VIM environment is ready to go.
